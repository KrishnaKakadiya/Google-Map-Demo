# Google-Map-Demo
A simple Google Maps Android Demo app. This app helps us to view a world map using the Google Map SDK.

The Google Maps App helps us to search for a location and indicate it on the map view with a custom marker image. Default camera view of map is placed on top of the perticular location and also all Google generated labels on the map are removed.
